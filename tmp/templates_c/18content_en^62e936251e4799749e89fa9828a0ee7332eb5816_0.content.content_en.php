<p>These are more complex then some of the other templates, especially the menus, they all 3 use the same menu template. Which shows you the power of CSS.</p><p>Be forewarned, if you use IE6 you won't see the best effects in any of the shadow menus that you see using a more standards compliant browser. I mean it's still nice grant you but... just upgrade your browser if you can.</p><h3>The Differences</h3><p>Starting with NCleanBlue you get a really nice, subtle Tabbed menu, then it goes on to have a real nice drop down effect.</p><p>You get a real nice 2.0 header and footer, great color scheme and the search is way cool, it's just a great theme, what can I say, thanks Nuno.</p><p>Then the next 2 submenus have another version of the shadowed drop, the first step will point up for the top sub menu and to the right for the left sub menus.</p><p>These 2 are the same layout as CSSMenu top + 2 columns and CSSMenu left + 1 column,  respectively, except for the menu template and some CSS.</p><p>We hope you enjoy these, for any changes you want to make it's always best to copy the original style sheet for safe keeping, you never know when you may need it.</p><?php }
